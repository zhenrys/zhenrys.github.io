<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>


I'm **Henry Zhang**, a senior student majoring in **Data Science** at the **School of Statistics and Data Science**, **Nankai University**.

During my undergraduate studies, I took a broad range of **mathematics and statistics courses**, which strengthened my analytical thinking and honed my skills in mathematical modeling. These experiences also nurtured my ability for **independent learning** and sparked my passion for practical algorithms in computer science.

My current academic interests center on **Computer Vision**, particularly **Vision–Language Models (VLMs) and Reinforcement Learning**. I am actively exploring cutting-edge approaches in this area to deepen my understanding of multimodal intelligence.

Beyond academics, I’m a **tech enthusiast** who enjoys keeping up with the latest digital innovations and gadgets. I’m also a **movie and TV series lover** — my all-time favorites include *Game of Thrones*, *The Lord of the Rings*, *Sherlock*, and *Star Wars*. In addition, I’m an avid **volleyball lover**.

If you share similar interests or would like to discuss research ideas, feel free to reach out to me at **[zhanghenryNKU@163.com](mailto:zhanghenryNKU@163.com)**.
